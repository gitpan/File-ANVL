	ANVL MODULE AND COMMAND SCRIPT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


ANVL OVERVIEW

ANVL (A Name Value Language) is a simple text-based record syntax
similar to email headers.  An ANVL record is a sequence of elements
ending in a blank line, where each element consists of a label, colon,
and value and long values may be continued on subsequent indented lines.
ANVL is somewhat comparable to the JSON and YAML syntaxes.


ANVL INSTALLATION

If not already unpacked, unpack the suite with

   tar xzf File-ANVL-0.1.tar.gz

after adjusting the version number as needed.  The current version is
known to pass build tests on Linux, Solaris, Mac, and Windows systems.

To install the module and script, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

For the "make install" you may have to become the superuser, as in,

   sudo make install
